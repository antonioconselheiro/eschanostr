# Eschalostr

Convert electricity into read friendly nostr npub.

## Running

**Basic run:**

`eschalostr --nregex "lojinha" --npassword "jesuslindo"`

or

`eschalostr -r "lojinha" -p "jesuslindo"`

**Complex regexes:**

`eschalostr --nregex "l[o0]j[i1]nh?[a4]" --npassword "jesusteama"`

You will search the names in a brute force algorithm, so if you fill the regex with all your read-friendly npub expectations so you can do it only once.

## How it works?

<pre>
Basically this N guy dances
until find a nsec
that derivate into a npub
that matches with your nregex
then print a ncryptsec
that you can open using you npassword
nnnnnnNnnnnnnnnNnnnnnnostr
